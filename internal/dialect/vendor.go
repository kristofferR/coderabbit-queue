package dialect

// Vendor is what a person needs to decide whether to use a review bot: what it
// is, what it costs, and what setting it up involves.
//
// It lives in dialect for the same reason every other bot string does — this is
// the one package allowed to know a bot by name. Nothing here affects a
// decision crq makes; it is read only by the guide.
//
// Prices carry no figures that are not in pricing.go, and no claim is made
// about which bot is better. The honest version of "which should I use" is a
// description of each and the criterion that distinguishes them.

	// Pitch is two or three lines, in plain terms, with no superlatives.
