// verdicts: it withdraws the finding (concedes) or retains it (contests). crq
// must read that reply — a contested rebuttal on a thread the agent already
// resolved would otherwise be silently dropped, and the agent would never learn
// the reviewer stood its ground. These classifiers own that wording; the
// surfacing decision lives in crq/feedback. The golden corpus pins CodeRabbit's
// real phrasing from testdata/coderabbit/reply-*.md.

// reviewWithdrawnMarker is CodeRabbit's machine-readable concession marker. It

// ("you're right—thank you for the precise correction"), and misreading one as
// a rebuttal re-surfaces a settled finding and blocks convergence.
